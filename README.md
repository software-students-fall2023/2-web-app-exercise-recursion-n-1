2. As a volunteer, I want to be able to browse a variety of volunteer opportunities in NYC, so I can choose the one that aligns with my interests and schedule.
3. As a nonprofit organization/user, I want to be able to post and manage volunteer opportunities on the app, so I can efficiently recruit and coordinate volunteers for our events.
4. As a volunteer, I want to be able to log into my account, so that I can keep my information safe.
5. As a new volunteer, I want to be able to create an account so I can explore all the opportunities of volunteering.
